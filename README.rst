MobileMMA
=========

A port of `MMA <http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/>`_ (Musical Midi Accompaniement)
for Android, using python and `Kivy <http://kivy.org>`_.

This is very early alpha software, dirty and ugly. Use at your own risk !

Install
-------

There is no .apk yet but you can run the program with `Kivy Launcher
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kivy.pygame>`_.

Just put the whole repo in a directory in /sdcard/kivy/, launch Kivy Launcher
and you're good to go !
